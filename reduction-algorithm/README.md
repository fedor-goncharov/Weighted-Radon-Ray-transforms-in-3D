## General information

The program reads on input ray transforms in 3D which are assumed to be given in layer-by-layer+'uniform sampling' form
and processes them to compute Radon transforms over the 2d-planes. 
It is important that the given data does not exactly slices all plane integrals, so some interpolation is used inside the main algorithm. 

On the input one gives a file with parameters of input and output (parameters of rays and plane integrals; config.txt),
file of input (-i filename), name of output file (-o fileoutput), (-n) number of OpenMP threads used for computations.
