Here we put realizations of several EM-algorithms for transmission and emission tomographies in 2D 
(in 3D it is difficult to make fast computations without parallelizations, which are more difficult in Python; 
maybe in future there will be realizations for 3D in written in C). 

Implementations are mostly inspired by lecture notes of J. Fessler from Michigan State University : Course EECS 516 - (see his website)
