Here we put realizations of several EM-algorithms for transmission and emission tomographies in 2D 
(in 3D it is difficult to make fast computations without parallelizations, which are more difficult in Python; 
maybe in future there will be realizations for 3D in written in C). 

Implementations are mostly inspired by lecture notes of J. Fessler from Michigan State University, 
Course EECS 516; see also his website https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/

EM-algorithms implemented : 

  Emission-tomography
     EM-algorithm of Shepp-Vardi (without acceleration using bounds for scattered photons)
     Improved algorithm of Shepp-Vardi (EM-ML-3) (with acceleration using bounds for scattered photons)
   
  X-ray transmission tomography
     EM Convex Newton-Raphson 1 (online computation of weights alpha_ij)
     EM Convex Newton-Raphson 2 (precomputable weights alpha_ij)
