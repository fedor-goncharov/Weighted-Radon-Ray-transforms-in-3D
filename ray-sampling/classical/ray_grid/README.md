## General information

	Program computes ray integrals in 3D of a test-function given not by an analitic expression, 
	but on a grid in a three-dimensional cube [-1,1]^3. The ray integrals are computed in a layer-by-layer 
	model, where cross sections are parallel to XY planes, uniformly shifted along OZ axis. In each 
	cross section the set of rays for which the ray transforms are evaluated satisfy 'uniform sampling model'.
